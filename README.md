This is a simple game where the user control an animated cat to catch food that falls from the sky.
Movement is controlled using A and D, and buttons are clicked using the mouse.

Food: There are 4 different types.

      Fish - gives one point
      
      Lobster - gives 3 points
      
      Burger - the jackpot that gives 25 points, or lives if leaked
      
      Bomb - to be avoided and 10 points are docked if not
Speed gradually increases as the game goes on, making it progressively more challenging.

When the game is over due to points hitting negative or lives reaching 0, the user may restart the game or return to the home page.
